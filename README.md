****Kingsley Aguguom****

**Hi, Iâ€™m Kingsley, a budding Data Analyst and Power BI Dashboard developer.**
With a strong foundational background in **Industrial Mathematics** from the Federal University of University, Minna, Niger state, I developed a keen analytical sense and approach to problem solving. This in turn spurred my passion towards using data to uncover meaningful insights. As such choosing a career path in data scince as a Data Analyst was the natural choice and I am excited to showcase my analytical skills.
